=== Known Limitations ===
* Packet broadcast is not implemented.
* ReportServiceList is implemented incorrectly - it only contains the service names, but none of the other metadata.
* ServiceMaster does not dynamically recompute the execution period should new services be added or deactivated.
* The ServiceMaster does not handle the access control/built-in packets at all.
