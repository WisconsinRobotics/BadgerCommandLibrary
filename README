=== Known Limitations ===
* ReportServiceList is implemented incorrectly - it only contains the service names, but none of the other metadata.
* The ServiceMaster partially handles the access control/built-in packets at all.
* The ServiceMaster uses an incorrect algorithm for scheduling services, but it may be good enough.
